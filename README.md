Hi! This is a mini e-commerce website I built for my Web Application Development assignment.

Features:
Browse and filter products
Add to cart & checkout (PHP backend)
Responsive design

Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

I created this to practice real-world workflows and make something clean and user-friendly. Feel free to explore the code!
